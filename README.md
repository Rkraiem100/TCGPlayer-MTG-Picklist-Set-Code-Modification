# TCGPlayer-MTG-Picklist-Set-Code-Modification
Takes the default TCGPlayer CSV picklist file and checks the set name against an internal INI to add a column with the set codes. This can help with inventory for medium to large sellers if you want to organize sets by the set code (where available) and easily match set codes on pick lists so you don't need to memorize set icons.
